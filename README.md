# Project Overview

This is a simple multi-page portfolio website that was inspired by Brad Traversy's code along on Youtube. The website is structured as follows: 

1. Home
2. About Me
3. Projects
4. Contacts

Every section is accessible via a click on the hamburger menu located in the top-right of the screen, and it's fully responsive. 

## How To Run 

+ clone the project or download it as a .zip file 
+ open the `dist/` folder
+ open the `index.html` file
+ view the website in your browser

### Dependencies 

This website doesn't use any frameworks and simply rely on HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS. 

#### Todos

This project is still "work in progress", and many features will be added, like: 

+ provide links to GitHub repos
+ add portrait image
+ add media queries for big screens
+ add animations and transitions
+ check accessibility and performance metrics
